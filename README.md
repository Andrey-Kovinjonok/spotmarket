There are many projects out there that record historical data from the API and present it to you. 

We want to go a step further and build an analysis platform that can incorporate data from the API and use it to create relationships to fuel predictions.
 
This project is an attempt to aggregate various data sources and present them in a meaningful way in order to make decision about trading, potential targets, and to verify activity levels of different types of gameplay.
